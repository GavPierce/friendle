Wordle...with friends!

## Dev Guide

Friendle is a web application built with the following technology stack:

### Client Side

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)

### Server Side

- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)

## Skills needed

To work on the web application it is recommended you have an understanding of the following skills, though this app will be largely an educational experience.

- [Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) friendle is programmed in TypeScript, which is javascript but strongly typed. If you have an understanding of javascript, you will learn how to make interfaces and types and why that greatly helps debugging and your programming experience. Measure twice, cut once.
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) friendle is a web application, meaning to render to someones browser we use the templating language HTML. HTML is the structure and the bones of the world wide web!
- [CSS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/index.htm) If HTML is the bones, CSS is our skin. If we know a little CSS already, we will be focusing on [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) best practice!!! For clean, understandable and scalable CSS.
- [API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82/) We need a basic understanding of the difference between "client" code and "server" code, and how they talk to each other! To do this, we create APIs.
